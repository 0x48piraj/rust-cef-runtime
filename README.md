# "Pure-GPU" HTML Renderer, minus the bullsh*t

A Rust-native Chromium runtime for building high-performance, GPU-accelerated desktop applications **without Electron and without system WebViews**.

Kurogane is a low-level Rust runtime built directly on the **Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)** for developers who need control, performance and consistency beyond OS-managed WebViews.

## Motivation

This project started as a "_GPU-accelerated FPS toy demo built with Tauri for the boys_" that performed extremely well on **Windows (WebView2)** out-of-the-box but encountered hard limitations on **Linux**:

* Compositor vsync limits i.e. VSync-locked rendering on WebKitGTK / WKWebView (~60 FPS)
* Inconsistent GPU paths across OSes
* Limited control over rendering lifecycle

Those constraints are inherent to _system WebViews_. So we pivoted to **CEF**. Chromium gives you the native GPU pipeline but most integrations come with baggage:

* **Electron** bundles Node.js, adds runtime overhead and constrains architecture
* **Custom Chromium builds** are complex, fragile and expensive to maintain

This project takes a different approach:

* Native, reliable Chromium GPU pipeline especially on Linux (and macOS)
* Explicit lifecycle and process control
* No embedded Node.js runtime
* Total control over process boundaries and IPC

## What this project optimizes for

This runtime is well-suited for:

* High-frequency rendering (WebGL/Canvas/WASM-heavy visualization workloads)
* Developers who want **Chromium without Electron**
* Cases where rendering behavior across platforms matters more than convenience
* Building custom shells, engines or non-standard desktop applications

> Anyone who likes Tauri's philosophy but prefers Chromium instead of WebViews.

When you should *not* use this project:

* You want the smallest binary: **use Tauri**
* You want Node.js APIs: **use Electron**
* You're building a standard CRUD UI: use **Tauri or Electron**

This project is not a replacement for Tauri or Electron.

## Getting started

### 1. Install Kurogane CLI (one-time)

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/0x48piraj/kurogane kurogane-cli
```

### 2. Create a new app

```bash
kurogane init
```

### 3. Install Chromium (one-time)

```bash
cd my-app
kurogane install
```

The CLI automatically downloads the compatible Chromium build required by the Rust bindings.

### 4. Run your app

```bash
kurogane dev
```

## Templates

Kurogane includes built-in templates to help you get started.

### Default app

```bash
kurogane init
```

A minimal starter template with a vanilla HTML frontend.

### Canvas demo (recommended)

```bash
kurogane init --template demo
```

Launches a native window rendering a **canvas-based animation** designed to reflect GPU-backed rendering performance.

This is the **primary demo** for evaluating rendering behavior and performance.

> **Rendering note**
>
> Unlike Chrome or Electron, this runtime does not ship with a browser helper process model. Some GPU features may behave differently depending on platform and driver configuration. These differences are architectural and not regressions in rendering performance.

### DOM-based educational demos

This template illustrates DOM animation limits, CPU-bound rendering behavior and are **NOT performance benchmarks**.

```bash
kurogane init --template dom
```

Learn from them:

* How main-thread vs compositor behavior affects rendering
* CPU costs of DOM-heavy animations
* Why WebGL / Canvas2D are preferred for high-frequency rendering

## Production packaging

Kurogane does not impose a packaging format.

In production, the embedding application is responsible for bundling frontend assets and selecting the startup URL.

For convenience, we include a straightforward way to do this:

```bash
kurogane bundle
```

Outputs a distributable app in the `dist/` directory.

## Philosophy

Good runtime design is a balancing act.

Too much abstraction can make a system rigid and difficult to extend. Too little structure leaves every application to solve the same problems repeatedly.

This project aims to sit between those extremes by providing a clear foundation while keeping the underlying internals accessible when needed.

We believe in providing a canonical way while keeping escape hatches.
